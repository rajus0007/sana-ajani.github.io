	  <h3><strong>Hey there! My name's Sana.</strong></h3>
	  <h4>I am a product manager interested in the intersection of tech, diversity, and education. Currently, I am a PM at Microsoft working on products such as VS Code and TypeScript.</h4>
		<h4>My passion is in creating social change in communities through the power of technology. I believe that we should provide equal access to education and STEM to every person, no matter their background or location.</h4>
		<h4>I'm also deeply interested in community building, having organized TEDx conferences at my alma mater, Georgia Tech, and am looking for cool opportunities in Seattle.</h4>	
		<h4>Outside of the office, I like reading, comedy shows, being active (running, soccer, hiking), and drinking coffee. Check out my <a href="{{ site.blog }}"></a>personal blog</a> or follow me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}">@{{ site.twitter }} for more into the life of a curious and optimistic girl learning how to live a meaningful #adult life.</h4>
