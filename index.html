	  <h3><strong>Hey there! I'm {{ site.author }}.</strong></h3>
	  <h4>I am a product manager interested in the intersection of tech, design, diversity, and social change. Currently, I work as a Program Manager at Microsoft on the VS Code and TypeScript team. I recently graduated from Georgia Tech, with a Computer Science degree, specializing in Modeling &amp; Simulation and Information Networks, and a minor in Business.</h4>
		<h4>In the past, I've been a lead organizer of <a href="https://www.tedxgeorgiatech.com">TEDxGeorgiaTech</a> at my school, a member of the business fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi, and a volunteer teaching AP Computer Science to high school girls. I've interned at various companies like American Express, working on their big data team, Microsoft as an Explorer Intern, and at CNN as a front-end developer.</h4>
		<h4>Outside of the office, I like reading, comedy shows, being active (running, soccer, hiking), and drinking coffee. Check out my blog for more into the life of a curious and optimistic Jersey gal learning how to live a meaningful life and #adult.</h4>
