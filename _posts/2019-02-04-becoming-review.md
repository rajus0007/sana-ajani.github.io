At the end of 2018, I read **Becoming** by Michelle Obama.

Michelle Obama is a fantastic storyteller. I felt comforted when reading about her childhood, her family, her values – it was all so relatable. I felt like I could see my own family and upbringing reflected in hers. What struck me the most was the Michelle was like me – an ordinary person who wanted to grow up and have a good job and her own healthy family. She grew up in middle-class family, one bounded together by love, but also discipline and awareness of where they had come from. Her parents invested everything in her and her brother, just like mine did for my sister and me. Somewhere between high school and college, you finally get it. You finally realize all the investment that your parents made in you, things you knew about it, and things you will quietly realize when you too choose to make those sacrifices for your children. Investment so we could have opportunities they never had. And Michelle realized it too. She goes to college and leans into experiences in order to awaken that boldness inside of her and reach for the life she wants. You grow up with immense gratefulness for the neighborhood you grew up in, your culture and race, your religion, your family, and you carry yourself in the present remembering that you are representing all these communities and identities.

She was an ordinary girl who has gone on to live an extraordinary life. And it all started because of education. Education is the key to upward mobility and future opportunities. She grasped that from the beginning, but she also realized when it was time to *swerve*. Michelle bravely took a step out of her comfort zone, departing from the comfort of a high-paying corporate lawyer job, to accept a position of less glamour, more stress, but also more fulfillment, community, meaning.

I was actually surprised to learn that she had to consider the same dilemma that most working women do: wanting to have a rewarding career, while trying to balance familial duties of being a mother, a wife, and trying to have a life, so she could volunteer or have hobbies. Wanting to have ambition and goals, but also gravitating towards the “stabilizing, self-sacrificing, seemingly bland normalcy of being a wife and mother.” I also found it relieving when she admitted that she didn’t initially share the same zeal and passion for politics that Barack did. That she even resented Barack at times because she felt she was making more sacrifices to hold their family together – the *“acute burden of being female”*. Somehow you have to balance career and passions and family and personal character. But it’s all worth it when you hear the first heartbeat and are carrying your children – the “privilege, the gift of being female.”
She admitted that during marriage counseling, she realized that she would have to anchor herself and understand how to make herself happy. She didn’t have to resent Barack or get completely swept up in the overflow from his life. *“It was possible that I was more in charge of my happiness than I was allowing myself to be.”*

She had to learn to take care of herself and love herself. There is no single definition of beauty to ascribe to. If you’re tall and got big hips, that’s fine. Do not lose your wholesomeness, your values, your culture, your intellect in the pursuit of someone else’s expectation of “beauty”. Be you. Keep growing. Be confident.

We can realize that while the world can be a messy and unfair place at times, it can also be an incredible and hopeful one. She was able to transcend past the traditional boundaries put around one’s ethnicity or childhood. Yes, she grew up in the South Side of Chicago. Yes, she was black. But, she had ambition. She was self-aware, carrying her confidence and values with her everywhere, which ultimately guided her to always treat people well. Michelle is true to her character and values that she was brought up on, reminding us that we must always carry ourselves with dignity and decency.

## Notable Quotes:
- “I … recognize the more universal challenge of squaring who you are with where you come from and where you want to go.”
- “Failure is a feeling long before it becomes an actual result. It’s vulnerability that breeds with self-doubt and then is escalated, often deliberately, by fear.”

- *When going to a new high school in a different part of town* “But my first months at Whitney Young gave me a glimpse of something that had previously been invisible – the apparatus of privilege and connection, what seemed like a network of half-hidden ladders and guide ropes that lay suspended overhead, ready to connect some but not all of us to the sky.”

- “Hearing [her male classmates], I realized that they weren’t at all smarter than the rest of us. They were simply emboldened, floating on an ancient tide of superiority, buoyed by the fact that history had never told them anything different.

- *On minorities, when moving into Princeton* “But even today, with white students continuing to outnumber students of color on college campuses, the burden of assimilation is put largely on the shoulders of minority students. In my opinion, it’s a lot to ask.” 

- “It was like stepping onstage at your first piano recital and realizing you’d never played anything but an instrument with broken keys. Your world shifts, but you’re asked to adjust and overcome, to play your music the same as everyone else.”

- “I was humbled and excited to be First Lady, but not for one second did I think I’d be sliding into some glamorous, easy role. Nobody who has the words “first” and “black” attached to them ever would.”

- “You only had to look around the faces in the room to know that despite their strengths these girls would need to work hard to be seen. There were girls in hijab, girls for whom English was a second language, girls whose skin made up every shade of brown. I knew they’d have to push back against the stereotypes that would get put on them, all the ways they’d be defined before they’d had a chance to define themselves. They’d need to fight the invisibility that comes with being poor, female, and of color. They’d have to work to find their voices and not be diminished, to keep themselves from getting beaten down. They would have to work just to learn. But their faces were hopeful, and now so was I. For me it was a strange, quiet revelation: They were me, as I’d once been. And I was them, as they could be. The energy I felt thrumming in that school had nothing to do with obstacles. It was the power of nine hundred girls striving.”

- “The important parts of my story, I was realizing, lay less in the surface value of my accomplishments and more in what undergirded them – the many ways I’d been buttressed over the years, and the people who’d helped build my confidence over time. I remembered them all, every person who’d ever waved me forward, doing his or her best to inoculate me against the slights and indignities I was certain to encounter in all the places I was headed – all those environments built primarily for and by people who were neither black nor female.” 

- “I was still earning my grace. I thought often of what I owed and to whom.”

- “This may be the fundamental problem with caring a lot about what others think: It can put you on the established path – the my-isn’t-that-impressive path – and keep you there for a long time. Maybe it stops you from swerving, from ever considering a swerve, because what you risk losing in terms of other people’s regard can feel too costly. … Your passion stays low, yet under no circumstance will you underperform. You live, as you always have, by the code of effort/result, and with it you keep achieving until you think you know the answers to all the questions – including the most important one. Am I good enough? Yes, in fact I am.” 

- *On devoting yourself to something bigger*: “It was one thing to get yourself out of a stuck place, I realized. It was another thing entirely to try and get the place itself stuck.” 

- “The choice, as [Barack] saw it, was this: You give up or you work for change… Do we settle for the world as it is, or do we work for the world as it should be?”

- “I’d learned that the world could be brutal and random, that hard work didn’t always assure positive outcomes…We understood, in other words, how ridiculously fortunate we were, and we both felt an obligation not to be complacent. Who were we? What mattered to us? What could we do?”

- “Women endure entire lifetimes of these indignities – in the form of catcalls, groping, assault, oppression. These things injure us. They sap our strength. Some of the cuts are so small they’re barely visible. Others are huge and gaping, leaving scars that never heal. Either way, they accumulate. We carry them everywhere, to and from school and work, at home while raising our children, at our places of worship, anytime we try to advance.”
