Nowadays, every time I turn on the TV or check my phone, there seems to be a new lead into the Trump/Russia investigation or some intelligence leaked by a sometimes-reliable source that will dominate the news cycle until the next intelligence leak (or until Trump tweets). Even when the news is not Trump-related, everything seems like it’s become a bunch of finger-pointing and Twitter-smearing, mixed with bouts of momentary outrage, perhaps a dash of local, short-term activism, and…that’s it. Then it’s gone.

Remember the United Airlines dragging? Remember the Pepsi Ad? Both of these happened less than two months ago, but both companies have basically bounced back and now these incidents will probably only resurface as side jokes in late-night comedy shows. Granted both companies did release statements of apology, but what surprises me is how quickly we go back to normal from an intense reaction. It’s as if we’ve all chosen to forget because we don’t really care or we’ve actually forgotten, in which case, as journalist Farhad Manjoo said, “media and culture seem stuck in an amnesiac loop”.

I think with news related to politics, the reason for this is probably _information overload_. Initially, when the Trump administration entered office, it was interesting to watch what they did, day-by-day, tweet-by-tweet. But now, I cringe as I click on what seems like a new story every day. I usually check Twitter and news sites, like WaPo, Vox, and CNN, for the latest, but with every news article or opinions piece, the more engrossed I am, the more overwhelmed I actually become. There is just too much happening and too many people reporting on different sides of each story that it’s become hard for us to unite behind any response to a particular issue or event. I think the rate at which news disseminates also contributes to the rate at which we get over it.


Here's what it seems like happens now:

- MONDAY: **BREAKING NEWS** alerts sent to our phones
- We quickly glance at the headline and think _Is it something that will bolster my current view of the topic? If so, I'll read it. Otherwise, I'll fall into "selective political amnesia"._
- For the rest of the day, every watercooler conversation with my coworkers or friends will circle around this topic. _Did you see what he just said? Can you believe it? You know what, I think it's actually XYZ_ and blah blah blah
- You’ll go home and watch the news about it on TV, but it’ll mostly be a bunch of the same noise and speculation by “experts”
- TUESDAY: **BREAKING NEWS** the same story moved forward an inch
- Lather, rinse, and repeat for the whole week
- FRIDAY: _I can’t even remember what happened earlier this week._


I think when it comes to news, whether it’s about a politician, a company, an international affair, we, as a society, are okay with extending the line that was originally drawn. I guess from now on, we’ll just take all our news covered in a low-friction, non-stick coating.
