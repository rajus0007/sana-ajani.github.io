Fyre festival

post-netflix notes
-this was all because of insta models and celebs hyping up something
    -they didn't know what it was, doesn't matter
-people's lives were ruined, no one even turned back to care
-what if this was a social experiment
-it's easy to market something that seems perfect, planning is hard
-didn't even plan for rain
-what was this guy's vision? how can you escape inevitability? you can't just keep lying
-white men have no bounds
-i remember when this was unfolding in real time, was laughing at all the memes of rich people
    -didn't realize the number of lives it messed up, the deeply fraudulent and morally corrupt behaviors
-instagram come to life    


post-hulu
-you want to be part of something that could be culturally relevant, not cuz the thing itself is so cool, but because
you want to tell everyone you were there. JOMO- joy of missing out
-is this really a millenial trend? or a rich people trend?
-perplexing and funny and horrible and criminal
-what is the model of success in the milennial world? moonshoot vision, create buzz and hype around the idea of it, figure it out later, measure if it
is worth by the hype it creates
-all this find your tribe shit is dumb; pretending to be connected by this tenuous desire to be associated with culture, art, music; when all
you really want is for other people to associate you with that
-flaunting this: "im young, carefree, tons of friends, i have money, look how comfortable i am" FUCK THAT, youre convincing your self and your friends
-that this one festival or experience will put me with the people I want to be around and think I am; we identify ourselves with what we're 
associated with or who is following us, am i following the trend, am I tagged?, because you see everyone else doing it, you're less of an individual
the performance of an attractive life -- fyre fest capitalized on this
-you can't help but be a brand if you're on social media;
-disconnection from reality, narcisstics
-visual disruption; everyone sees sameness
-"managing expectations" -- ever sign up for something you know will be too good to be true
-schadenfreude
-living in a penthouse away from it all
